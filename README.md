# Bonita BPM Platform Installer

This is part of [Bonitasoft](http://www.bonitasoft.com) Living Days #2 (July 2014) organized while celebrating 5th anniversary of the company.

An idea was to facilitate the installation of Bonita BPM platform starting from our famous Tomcat H2 bundle.
As a result we built an installer which enables to customize Tomcat and database configuration.
It also allows to bundle JRE and PostgreSQL database as an option.

This tool is built using [BitRock InstallBuilder](http://installbuilder.bitrock.com).
